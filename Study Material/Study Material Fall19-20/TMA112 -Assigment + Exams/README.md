## TMA Q1

Dear Students,

In Q1 of the TMA, you will write a report about a topic that is not from your book. accordingly you need to search the internet first for references about the issues raised on the question and more information.

You have a limited number of words that could only cover the issues mentioned.

Remember that you need to write a report so you need to follow the following structure.

    - Introduction (no more than one line or a line and half)
    - Body (issues raised in the question)
    - Conclusion  (no more than one line or a line and half)
    - References (copy paste URLs of the sites you used)

Please pay attention that you need add one figure or one table to the report and be careful about the word count (references list is not included in the word count)

If you have any concerns please post to the Tutor Group Forum to discuss.



## TMA Q2

Dear Students,

Just to remind you of what we discussed about Q2 of the TMA in the last two tutorials.

    - Use the example of slide 36 from meeting 4 as a template for the solution.
    - Q2 gives many tips and instructions that you MUST follow to solve the problem.
    
When you submit the TMA, please include in your answer (word file) screen shots of both your code and run. Also compress the word file with your python file so i can run it on my PC and check it myself. not including the python will result in losing marks so pay attention.
